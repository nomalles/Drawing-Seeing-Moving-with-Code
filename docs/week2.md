#Loops and Trigonometry

####Update Git
* Update your fork of the class repository. ([Instructions from here.](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/))
  * First make sure your online repository has you homework.
  * Then in the terminal cd to whereever your local repo is where you are working
  * Make sure they are synced. (`git status`) will tell you this
  * You may need to `git pull` which will bring in your online changes to your local repository
  * Now your local and your remote version should be matched. `git status` showing no red lines!
  * Now you are going to pull in the new examples for this week from the master repository. `git checkout gh-pages`
  * And pull the updated branch from the main repo
  `git pull https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code.git gh-pages`
  * Fingers crossed you have no merge conflicts. (If you do, talk to me)
  * Push your now updated local repo to your repo online `git push origin gh-pages`
* Github markdown. You may with to use Markdown reader such as [MacDown for mac](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) or [Markdown pad for windows](http://markdownpad.com/)

###Using a local server

* There will come a time when you want to load images or fonts or sound into your sketch. This means we have to use a local server. [Follow these instructions to get one set up.](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)

###Examples
* Try the load image example to see a local server in action.
* Trigonometry review and loops. All these example are in folders in your 

####Load an Image
* [Example 2.4: Load an image](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/tree/gh-pages/code/2-4-LoadImage/image-1)
* [Example 2.4: Load an image with a callback](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/tree/gh-pages/code/2-4-LoadImage/image-2-callback)


####Trigonometry
*See chapter 3 in [Nature of Code.](http://natureofcode.com/)*  
Angular motion

* [Example 2-3: Trig angularVel](http://codepen.io/tega/pen/BjVEzE?editors=0010)  

Polar & Cartesian coordinates  

* [Example 2-3: Trig circularMotion](http://codepen.io/tega/pen/pgKBEj?editors=0010)  

Oscillation

* [Example 2-3: Trig sinWave](http://codepen.io/tega/pen/zraXKZ?editors=0010)  
* [Example 2-3: Trig sinScaling](http://codepen.io/tega/pen/rxKbqz?editors=0010)  
* [Example 2-3: Trig sinCosMotion](http://codepen.io/tega/pen/EPRJGQ?editors=0010)


####Loop Example

* [Example 2-2: Loop with frame Export](http://codepen.io/tega/pen/MKQpOX?editors=0010)



###Tutorial Outline

####Submit your Week 1 homework

* Pull request to Github (submit your homework)
  * Now you have everything synced and updated. Let's make your first pull request. This is where you are asking to add your new work to the class repo.
  * First navigate to your online repository
  * Find the *New Pull Request* button. Press it and you should see information on the changes between your repo and the main one. Create the request and I will then accept.
  * Well done! You've made your first pull request.

####Trigonometry Exercises
* See chapter 3 in [Nature of Code.](http://natureofcode.com/) or this draft primer [on trig over here.](http://www.trig.tegabrain.com/)
* With one line of code, transform the circular motion example into a spiral
* Create a pulsing sketch where a color oscillates with sine. (You could hack the sinScaling example.
* Create a spiral function and create a series of spirals, organizing them into a composition. 


###Deliverables:

* Finish trig exercises. 
* Work on your loop project. You should start by posting a series of 3 sketches of how your loop will work and come to class with a sketch for refinement in class time next week. 
* Do [this reading by Michael Naimark](http://www.naimark.net/writing/firstword.html) and make a [discovery and research report](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/blob/gh-pages/docs/deliverables.md) describing an example of either firstword or lastword art. If you are stuck for ideas on where to look for works, see the list at the end of [the resources page.](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/blob/gh-pages/docs/techResources.md)
